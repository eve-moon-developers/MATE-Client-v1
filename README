This repository contains the static files for the Eclipse MATE Application. It is designed to be hosted on a CDN service such as S3/Cloudfront.

Try to keep all sources internal. (This may not be best practice, but later there may be some compilation techniques used.)


Directory Structure

Each tool gets a page. Sub-sections are hashpaths. Javascript must load everything else.

/index.html (homepage)

/common/ (Things shared between all tools. For compatibility reasons.)
/common/src/ (Common javascript files written by us.)
/common/ext/ (Common javascript files written by someone else.)
/common/style/
/common/image/
/common/font/
/common/html/
/common/data/

/{module}.html (Homepage for the module)
/{module}/... Follows the same structure as common.

/error/ (Contains common error pages with redirection back to the home page)

That is it for static data.
